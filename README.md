Requirement (hypothetical)

BBC London has approached my company for a website-based game.

* They wish for something that will tap into the current zeitgeist of the political process occurring as of late 2019, namely Brexit. Because Brexit is quite decisive and polarising, they have stated that they want the game to merely focus on the political process of voting and avoid the real political topic of the EU exit referendum.

* Following a short meeting I was given a small budget and asked to create a prototype of a potential game that would allow members of the public to try and understand what it feels like to be a politician during the electoral run. This they speculate would be interesting enough for a member of the public to give them a small, but somewhat limited taste of becoming one of the currently more disliked career opportunities in the public eye.

* The BBC has said they are exploring other avenues for something of entertainment value to fulfil their current need, and therefore they simply require something to put to their director of entertainment body in 10-15 days for a concept test.

* In addition, they have stated for legal reasons they do not wish that I utilize any names of real current politicians, as there are strict guidelines regarding the political process, and they wish to avoid anything that could be construed as potentially libellous.

* Also, they have said not to worry too much about performance, for if the game is selected for production, they will redesign with appropriate technologies conducive to large scale public consumption, similar to many other similar endeavours of which they are experienced in. They simply want to see a working prototype quickly.

## 1 - UX

Within the following section I will describe various elements and thoughts that went into my design for the project. I will follow the tried and trusted five stage design principles used in my working style, namely

* Strategy
* Scope
* Structure
* Skeleton
* Surface

In addition, I may include rough sketches. They may not be born into the final game but are included for completeness. The code was created quickly and leaves room for optimisation I am sure. However, my focus was getting a working prototype available for review.
